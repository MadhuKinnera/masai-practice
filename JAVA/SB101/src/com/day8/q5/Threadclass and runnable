Difference between Thread class and Runnable interface to create a thread is

Thread class
------------

* Inheritance is closed due to extending the Thread class

* if we didnt override run method no output produced

Runnable Interface
------------------

* We can inherit another class

* we definetily need to override run method

* we need to create object for Thread seperately
