Difference between Synchronization method and block
---------------------------------------------------

1. Sync Method is creates by adding a synchronized keyword to the method.
which we need to excute in a critical section.

2. Sync Block is the part of method where the actual code which needs 
critical section

3. By using the sync block the code which doesnt need critical section is used by 
another threads simutanously

4. This helps to avoid data inconsistency along with fast performance.

5. Using Sync Method may increase application response time and leads 
to bad experience.

6. Using blocks whereever it is required is recommended.

7. Sync method means no another thread is allowed to use the method until 
the current thread excution completes.
