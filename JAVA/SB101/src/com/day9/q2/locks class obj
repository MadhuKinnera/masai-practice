Difference between class lock and object lock
----------------------------------------------

1. A class contains one lock which is represents the static synchronised methods.

2. An object can also one lock but we can have n number of objs the one class

3. For a class one class level key and any number of object keys available


4. The threads created on a same object has no permision to excute the sync methods
until another same obj thread excutes it.

5. While a static sync is excuting no other static syncs are allowed to excute.
