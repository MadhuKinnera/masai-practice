If we run run method instead of start method 

it will go to the thread and excute the code present there and then 
the main thread will excute 

we can run a thread multiple times 

but we can not start a thread more than 1 time

We also run the thread after starting or before startig the thread

and the priority of the thread which called run is same as parent ..
