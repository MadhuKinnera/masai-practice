Difference between statement and prepared statement
----------------------------------------------------


Statement
---------
using this we can create a sql statement which will excuted by db engine

every time we run the program the statement will do 

1. query compilation

2. query plan recognisation

3. query optimisation


there is a chance for sql injection




PreparedStatement
-----------------

using this also we can create sql statement which is excuted by db engine


this will comile only once


there is no chance for sql injection
