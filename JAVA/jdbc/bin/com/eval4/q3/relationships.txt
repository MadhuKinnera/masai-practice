Relationships among  tables in database
---------------------------------------
in dbms  there are 3 types of relations exits
1. One to one 
2. one to many 
3. many to many

one to one relation ship

--------------------------
in this two tables are in one to one relationship 

unique data present over the tables

the foreign key must be unique

one person contain only one aadhaar card and one aadhaar is only for one person


many to one
-----------
in this one table contains foreign key which is primary key
in another table 

one table contain only unique data in primary key

another table contain foreign key which accepts duplicates also

* in this relationship a table can create many rows usign another table primary key

example

one student can take many courses

also

one course can allowed to take by so many student


here we need another table to manage the student and course
