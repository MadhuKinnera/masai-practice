}
//EXPLAINING THE OUTPUT
/*
1. here we a+b are integers and we need to store in a smaller datatype so
we need to typecast explicitly
2. the a+b will give integer as result to we need to typecast that into
byte to store the result in byte.
3. the size of byte datatype is 1byte .Hence the range is 
from -128 to 127;
4. the a+b will give 134 as results .but that is not present in byte range
so it will reiterate through range 
example: integer 128 is not in byte instead of that in the byte range 
cycle there is -128 present next to 127
5. so here 134 have the value 7 extra to its positive range so it will go 
backwards from 128 and it will reach -122.
example-
 127 127
 128 -128
 129 -127
 130 -126
 131 -125
 132 -124
 133 -123
 134 -122..
