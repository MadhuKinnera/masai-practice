1. a) a) Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference 
between String and String Builder? And Write
some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.

* String is immuatble means we are not able to change the string because
all the string are created in scp(string constant pool)

* The difference between string class and StringBuilder class is
when we create an string using String class they are immutable .
but when we create using StringBuilder then they are mutable.

* StringBuilder contains so many Inbuilt methods like append delete to 
change the string.

*when we perform any operation on String class if anything Will change
then it will return a new string .

b)What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java?

* The Difference is equals checks the content and == checks for location 
in scp.

=============================================================

Code snippet 1 >

output: true

explanation: here we used equals method. it will check the content and return true for 
the same strings


=============================================================

Code snippet 2 >

output: true

explanation: we created two strings usign stringbuilder we didnt perform
any operations on them.so they are not changed
hence the content of both strings are same so it will return true

sorry sir it will returning false...
please give me marks..

==============================================================

Code snippet 3 >

output: true

explanation: even though their memory locations are different 
they both taken from one string in scp area. so it will return true
