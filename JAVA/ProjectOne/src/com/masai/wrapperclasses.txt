Genarally Like C++ and other languages they are not fully Object Oriented 
languages .
Primitive datatypes representing in Objects in Known as Wrapper classes.
But Java is a fully Object orented language.Fully OOPs means there is no 
primitives(Primitive datatype) ..to make the primitives into Objects 
The wrapper classes are used Hence Java is a fully OOPs language 
in some situations in java the primitives are not allowed there the 
wrapper classes helps very much 
Wrapper classes has also some extra methods ..so they are better than the 
primitive data types.
