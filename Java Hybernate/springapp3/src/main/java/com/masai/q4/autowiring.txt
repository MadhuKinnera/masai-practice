What is auto wiring in Spring, how many types of Auto wiring are there in spring,
explain with an example.

* the process of injecting the values automatically is called autowiring.
* we can use the autowire attribute in xml or @autowire annotation to achieve it.

there are 4 types of autowiring 

1. No autowiring
*by default it doesnot follow autowiring
* we can able to inject values explicitly

2. byName
* for this autowiring the name of the field and bean must be same.

3. byType
* for this the type of the bean and the dependency is to match.
* if more than one type of same beans located it will raise an exception

4. constructor
* using constructor only we can inject the values.
