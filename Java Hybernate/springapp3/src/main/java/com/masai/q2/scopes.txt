How many scopes are there for a Spring Bean, which is the default scope for a Spring
Bean? Explain with an example.


There are 5 scopes in spring bean 
1. singleton
2. prototype
3. request
4. session
5. global session

* the default scope of a spring bean is singleton

every time we create an bean object it will give the same reference object everytime.
