===========================================================================

setter injections
------------------
* using setters we can inject values
* partial insertion is possible
* for less no of properties it is recommended
* it has higher prorioty than constructor injection



constructor injection
----------------------

* using constructor we will inject values
* partial insertion is not possible
* more number of properties constructor is recommended
* it has lower prorioty than setter injection
* used to inject values for final variables
