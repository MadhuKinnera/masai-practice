2) Explain about IOC and Dependency Injection.
================================================

IOC (Inversion of Control )
----------------------------

* It is a process where the objects defines their dependencies .

* it is a approch to outsource creating and managing the objects 

* it can be achived through the dependency injection.

Dependency Injection
---------------------

* It is process of assigning values to the dependencies in dependent spring bean class.

* these are 2 types

1. setter injection

* here setter method is used to assign the value to the dependencies in dependent.

there are 3 types of values possible 

1. primitives and string for this we use value attribute.

2. User defined objects for this we use ref attribute to assign value

3. Collections and normal array


* setting values are optional


2. Constructor injection

* using parameterized constructor we can assign the values to the dependencies.

* in the constructor injection we use constructor-arg attibute in the bean tag

* using this injection circular dependency may happen it leads to an exception.

* here we mandatory  to specify values of parameters of constructor
