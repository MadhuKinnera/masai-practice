Entity Class LifeCycle
======================

1. new state
-------------

* whenever an object created for the entity class 
then the object is said to be new state / transient state

2.Persistence state
--------------------
* it is a state where the entity class object is in sync with 

database table.

* if we modify data in object it will reflect on database
and vice versa

* while the entity class object is used with the entity manager 
then it said to be in persistence state


3. detached state
------------------

* it is a state where the table and object are independent 
to themselves

* we use merge to go back to persistence state.
