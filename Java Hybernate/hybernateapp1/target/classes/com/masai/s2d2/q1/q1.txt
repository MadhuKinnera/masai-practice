Limitations of Entity Manager
==============================

1. Using Entity Manager we can only perform following 4 operations.

  1.find()
  2.persist()
  3.remove()
  4.merge()
  
  * we can't find a Object without using primary key.
  * we can't persist() a object without any missing value (partial insertion)
  * we can't insert or remove bulk of data in database
  * we can't write our own needed query.
