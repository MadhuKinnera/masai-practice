What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?
======================================================

* Hibernate is a ORM software framework used to map java objects 
into Relation database mangament system.

* Hibernate Implements Java Persistence API so we can use 
either hibernate apis or JPA api from hibernate

* in JDBC We manually require need to write queries.

* in JDBC So much code repeatation is there while taking connection

* We have to handle Checked Exceptions in JDBC

* Retriving the data consumes more varaibles to store relation data
in individual variables.

* JDBC Doesn't handle Mismatch like 
IS-A mismatch
HAS-A mismatch
Relational Mismatch


* Performing DML and various operations made easy in Hibernate .

* we can easily add hibernate in maven instead of adding all 

jar files in classpath manually in jdbc.
