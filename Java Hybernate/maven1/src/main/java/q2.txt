1. Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate.
==============================================

JPA(Java Persistence API)
----
* It is an specification for ORM Softwares

* It can able to communicate with all ORM softwares.

* It is Used to Map Java Objects into Database Relation.
using any one ORM.

* it is ORM independent


Hibernate
---------
* it is an one of the ORM software which implements JPA

* It is an individual ORM software though it can't communicate
with any other ORM software framework.

* It Directly Map Java Object Into Database Relation.

* It is ORM Dependent.

2. Explain the Life-cycle of Entity class with example
=======================================================

There are 3 stages in of entity Class .

1. new State

2. Persistance State

3. Detached State


1. New State 
-------------

* in this state The Entity class object is created and not connected with any 
relation..

ex: Student s = new Student(10,"Ram",780);

2.Persistence State
--------------------

* in this state The Object is in Sync with Database Relation..

* Updating in Entity class object will reflect in table..

* Updating in relation reflect in java object.

* in this phase we perform DML operation or CRUD Operations

3. Detached State
-----------------

* in this state the The Entity class Object is not in sync with 
database relation.

* hence the changes are not reflect.

* using merge we reflect the changes even if it is in detached state.
